And by reading the code, you can force it to the same old behavior by passing in empty storage_options\\n\\n### Expected Behavior\\n\\nfile with hdfs:/// can be load properly. \\n\\n### Installed Versions\\n\\n<details>\\r\\n\\r\\nINSTALLED VERSIONS\\r\\n------------------\\r\\ncommit              : ba1cccd19da778f0c3a7d6a885685da16a072870\\r\\npython              : 3.9.18.final.0\\r\\npython-bits         : 64\\r\\nOS                  : Linux\\r\\nOS-release          : 5.4.0-150-generic\\r\\nVersion             : #167~18.04.1-Ubuntu SMP Wed May 24 00:51:42 UTC 2023\\r\\nmachine             : x86_64\\r\\nprocessor           : x86_64\\r\\nbyteorder           : little\\r\\nLC_ALL              : None\\r\\nLANG                : None\\r\\nLOCALE              : None.None\\r\\n\\r\\npandas              : 2.1.0\\r\\nnumpy               : 1.26.1\\r\\npytz                : 2023.3.post1\\r\\ndateutil            : 2.8.2\\r\\nsetuptools          : 63.4.3\\r\\npip                 : 22.2.2\\r\\nCython              : None\\r\\npytest              : None\\r\\nhypothesis          : None\\r\\nsphinx              : None\\r\\nblosc               : None\\r\\nfeather             : None\\r\\nxlsxwriter          : None\\r\\nlxml.etree          : None\\r\\nhtml5lib            : None\\r\\npymysql             : None\\r\\npsycopg2            : None\\r\\njinja2              : 3.0.3\\r\\nIPython             : 7.34.0\\r\\npandas_datareader   : None\\r\\nbs4                 : None\\r\\nbottleneck          : None\\r\\ndataframe-api-compat: None\\r\\nfastparquet         : None\\r\\nfsspec              : 2023.10.0\\r\\ngcsfs               : None\\r\\nmatplotlib          : None\\r\\nnumba               : None\\r\\nnumexpr             : None\\r\\nodfpy               : None\\r\\nopenpyxl            : None\\r\\npandas_gbq          : None\\r\\npyarrow             : 14.0.0\\r\\npyreadstat          : None\\r\\npyxlsb              : None\\r\\ns3fs                : 2023.10.0\\r\\nscipy               : None\\r\\nsqlalchemy          : 1.4.46\\r\\ntables              : None\\r\\ntabulate            : 0.9.0\\r\\nxarray              : None\\r\\nxlrd                : None\\r\\nzstandard           : None\\r\\ntzdata              : 2023.3\\r\\nqtpy                : None\\r\\npyqt5               : None\\r\\n\\r\\n</details>\\r\\n\",\n",

I was surprised to see that there are no default round method ?\\r\\nBest use of round would be to precise the type of round (day/seconds/...) but I think it should have a default behavior.\\r\\nIn a pythonic way.\\r\\nAnd I think seconds should be the default.\\n\\n### Expected Behavior\\n\\nIt should have a default behavior, in a pythonic way.

This creates discrepancies between using `my_func(df[\\'foo\\'])` and `df.eval(\\'@my_func(foo)\\')` where the former preserves the correct name.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis seems Linux-only issue: Running on Windows preserves the name. Based on the unittests, it looks like everything works fine for the MacOS as well, albeit I wasn\\'t able to test it directly.\\n\\n### Expected Behavior\\n\\nNames of the series to be preserved (i.e., `sr.name == \"foo\"` in the first case and `sr.name  == \"baz\"` in the second).\\n\\n### Installed Versions\\n\\n<details>\\r\\n\\r\\nINSTALLED VERSIONS\\r\\n------------------\\r\\ncommit           : 2e218d10984e9919f0296931d92ea851c6a6faf5\\r\\npython           : 3.11.7.final.0\\r\\npython-bits      : 64\\r\\nOS               : Linux\\r\\nOS-release       : 6.6.13-1rodete3-amd64\\r\\nVersion          : #1 SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Debian 6.6.13-1rodete3 (2024-03-04)\\r\\nmachine          : x86_64\\r\\nprocessor        : \\r\\nbyteorder        : little\\r\\nLC_ALL           : None\\r\\nLANG             : en_US.UTF-8\\r\\nLOCALE           : en_US.UTF-8\\r\\n\\r\\npandas           : 1.5.3\\r\\nnumpy            : 1.24.2\\r\\npytz             : 2023.3.post1\\r\\ndateutil         : 2.8.2\\r\\nsetuptools       : 68.1.2\\r\\npip              : 23.3\\r\\nCython           : 3.0.8\\r\\npytest           : 7.4.4\\r\\nhypothesis       : None\\r\\nsphinx           : None\\r\\nblosc            : None\\r\\nfeather          : None\\r\\nxlsxwriter       : None\\r\\nlxml.etree       : 5.1.0\\r\\nhtml5lib         : 1.1\\r\\npymysql          : None\\r\\npsycopg2         : None\\r\\njinja2           : 3.1.2\\r\\nIPython          : 8.20.0\\r\\npandas_datareader: None\\r\\nbs4              : 4.12.3\\r\\nbottleneck       : 1.3.5\\r\\nbrotli           : 1.1.0\\r\\nfastparquet      : None\\r\\nfsspec           : None\\r\\ngcsfs            : None\\r\\nmatplotlib       : 3.6.3\\r\\nnumba            : 0.57.1\\r\\nnumexpr          : 2.9.0\\r\\nodfpy            : None\\r\\nopenpyxl         : 3.1.2\\r\\npandas_gbq       : None\\r\\npyarrow          : None\\r\\npyreadstat       : None\\r\\npyxlsb           : None\\r\\ns3fs             : None\\r\\nscipy            : 1.10.1\\r\\nsnappy           : \\r\\nsqlalchemy       : None\\r\\ntables           : 3.7.0\\r\\ntabulate         : None\\r\\nxarray           : None\\r\\nxlrd             : 2.0.1\\r\\nxlwt             : None\\r\\nzstandard        : None\\r\\ntzdata           : None\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n</details>\\r\\n',\n",

This creates discrepancies between using `my_func(df[\\'foo\\'])` and `df.eval(\\'@my_func(foo)\\')` where the former preserves the correct name.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis seems Linux-only issue: Running on Windows preserves the name.
